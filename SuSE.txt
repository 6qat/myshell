This is the umpteenth time I looked up what build-essential is on openSUSE. 
For my purposes, itâ€™s the devel_basis pattern. To see what packages have the pattern:

zypper info -t pattern devel_basis

Yes it has a lot of packages, but I usually end up installing many of those anyways.
To install devel_basis:

sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_basis
